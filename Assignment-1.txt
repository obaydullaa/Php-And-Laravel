1.What is the Feasibility Study of the SDLC model & why is this important?
===============================================================================================

   Ans: SDLC model: The main aim of SDLC is to develop high-quality software at the lowest cost and in the shortest time in a systematic and professional way. SDLC is used in software engineering to structure the development process of a software product in a systematic and organized manner.

   There are several reasons why we need an SDLC Mdoel: 1.Ensures quality 2.Promotes efficient use of         resources 3. Increases accountability 4.Facilitates communication 5.Supports project management 

   

2.Write 5 advantages of Agile methodology.
==================================================================================================

  Ans: Agile methodology: An Agile methodology is project management practice that promotes a collaborative,   iterative and incremental approach to project management.
  1.Fast feature development 2.Continuous customer involvement 3.Constant improvement 4.Flexibility 5. Customer satisfaction


3.Write short notes on SDLC model phase.
===================================================================================================

    Ans:The entire SDLC process divided into the following SDLC steps.
    1.Requirement collection and analysis:- The requirement is the first stage in the SDLC process. It is conducted by the senior team members with inputs from all the stakeholders and domain experts in the industry.
   
    2.Feasibility study: Once the requirement analysis phase is completed the next sdlc step is to define and document software needs.

    3.Design: In this third phase, the system and software design documents are prepared as per the requirement specification document. This helps define overall system architecture.

    4.Coding: Once the system design phase is over, the next phase is coding. In this phase, developers start build the entire system by writing code using the chosen programming language.

   5.Testing: Once the software is complete, and it is deployed in the testing environment. The testing team starts testing the functionality of the entire system.

   6.Installation/Deployment: Once the software testing phase is over and no bugs or errors left in the system then the final deployment process starts. 

   7.Maintenance: Once the system is deployed, and customers start using the developed system, following 3 activities occur
    Bug fixing – bugs are reported because of some scenarios which are not tested at all
    Upgrade – Upgrading the application to the newer versions of the Software
    Enhancement – Adding some new features into the existing software
